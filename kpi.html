            <div style="width: 100%; text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 600;">Payback Period:</span> time at which benefits achieved outweigh amount invested. If you invest £12 and receive £1 per month, your payback period is 1 year, equal to the "break-even point”. This calculation does not consider the time value of money (see NPV)</div>

            <div style="width: 100%; text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 600;">Net Present Value (NPV):</span> the present value of future net Cashflows (cash in minus cash out). “Present Value” refers to the time value of money where a pound today is worth more than a pound five years from now. This is due to inflation, future uncertainty and other factors. The NPV here is calculated assuming a default 8% cost of capital.</div>
